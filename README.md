# voice-control-car-embedded-system-
Description: This repository contains code that enables a voice-controlled car to move in the forward or backward direction. The project utilizes IoT technology to facilitate communication between the user's voice commands and the car's movement.
Installation:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that you have the necessary hardware components (e.g., microcontroller, motor driver) properly connected to the car.
Install the required dependencies listed in the project's documentation.
Usage:

Configure the audio input device to capture the user's voice commands.
Run the main script, which listens for voice input and interprets the commands accordingly.
The program will analyze the input and send corresponding signals to the motor driver, controlling the car's movement
